# PHANTOMX / FLASH LOAN GHOST HUNTER
# PROJECT STATUS • MASTER CONTINUITY • MISSION CONTROL

> Canonical project-state anchor. Synchronize only on substantive state transitions. Evidence first, fail closed, no fabricated passes.

## CURRENT MISSION
The project goal is not Phase-19. The goal is a working, evidence-backed Polygon flash-loan arbitrage MVP that can progress from real market opportunity discovery through exact route economics, simulation, controlled execution, on-chain settlement, and proof that realized net profit is strictly greater than $0.20 after all applicable costs.

## CURRENT MVP ORDER
1. Real opportunity discovery.
2. Exact live quotes at one pinned block.
3. Executable A→B→A route construction.
4. Complete worst-case economics and strict `net > $0.20` gate.
5. Deterministic execution assembly and EVM preflight.
6. Governor/safety controls.
7. External signer/provider/private-relay/shadow verification.
8. Controlled execution.
9. Settlement reconciliation.
10. Realized PnL proof `> $0.20`.
11. Independent final audit and release freeze.

## DYNAMIC MARKET AUTONOMY
- Canonical policy: `PHANTOMX_DYNAMIC_MARKET_AUTONOMY_POLICY.md`.
- Integration sequence: DYN-1 live Aave liquidity/premium -> DYN-2 liquidity-aware loan domain -> DYN-3 exact execution gas -> DYN-4 all-cost EconomicProof -> DYN-5 final requote/state lock -> DYN-6 strategy registry -> DYN-7 adaptive RPC fleet -> DYN-8 scheduler -> DYN-9 external gates -> DYN-10 controlled execution/PnL.
- Market-dependent values remain dynamic; only safety invariants and explicit policy bounds are frozen.

## CURRENT STATE
- Branch: `phase-19-e2e-harness`
- Current HEAD at this sync: `eb275ea23deb935990fd501b67088fbde3b135aa` (`feat(P0): record nearest-to-profit First-Hunt evidence`).
- Latest verified engineering commit at this sync: `eb275ea23deb935990fd501b67088fbde3b135aa` (`feat(P0): record nearest-to-profit First-Hunt evidence`).
- Latest verified Phase-19 CI certification: workflow run `587` / run ID `35319516515` **GREEN** on `eb275ea23deb935990fd501b67088fbde3b135aa`; Solidity compilation, EVM integration (**14 tests**), Polygon fork protocol smoke (**3 tests**), Polygon fork execution probe (**1 test**), and the full Phase-19 unittest suite (**717 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors**) all completed successfully. The workflow checked out the exact branch HEAD with `fetch-depth: 0`.
- The latest live-discovery increment adds exact Uniswap V3 fee-tier enumeration across 100/500/3000/10000 and a read-only First-Hunt Actions scan. First-Hunt workflow run `7` / run ID `35284988643` is **GREEN**; it produced 340 exact observations on `polygon.drpc.org` and 374 on `polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com`, with zero gross-positive candidates. The scan is observation-only and performs no signing, submission, broadcast, or live-capital operation.
- The verified cleanup removes the duplicate Governor test module `tests/phase19/test_execution_governor.py`; canonical Governor coverage remains in `tests/phase19/test_governor.py` and the existing canonical pipeline tests. The canonical Governor implementation remains `phantomx/governor.py`.
- `phantomx/live_opportunity_pipeline.py` provides concrete cross-venue discovery → complete economic evaluation → deterministic execution assembly → EVM preflight. It performs no signing, submission, broadcast, or live-capital operation.
- `phantomx/live_canonical_governor.py` composes concrete discovery, economics, assembly, preflight, and the repository's canonical Governor before the signer boundary. It performs no signing, submission, broadcast, or live-capital operation.
- `phantomx/execution_coordinator.py` is the durable bridge from proven route/economic evidence through nonce reservation/binding, EVM preflight, canonical Governor, signer, and transaction persistence. Failures before signing release an uncommitted nonce reservation; post-signing persistence failures retain the reservation for forensic recovery.
- `phantomx/live_execution_coordinator.py` now bridges concrete cross-venue discovery and complete economic evaluation into `prepare_signed_execution`; it performs no public/private relay submission or live-capital operation.
- Concrete cross-venue discovery remains pinned to one canonical Polygon block across both supported venue directions and the complete supplied loan-size frontier.
- `phantomx/opportunity_economics.py` remains the economic binding layer: discovered candidates are joined to explicit valuation/cost evidence to create hash-bound `EconomicProof`; below-floor proofs remain evidence-only and cannot reach execution.
- `phantomx/loan_optimizer.py` remains exact-domain and complete: all supplied integer amounts are evaluated, mixed block/chain candidates are rejected, and ties resolve to the smaller loan.
- The economic invariant is unchanged: realized net profit must be **strictly greater than $0.20 after all applicable costs**.
- Current First-Hunt loan frontier at this sync is expanded to 17 explicit USDC sizes from $100 through $250,000; the frontier is complete only over these supplied amounts.
- First-Hunt run `11` / run ID `35319516439` is **GREEN** on `eb275ea23deb935990fd501b67088fbde3b135aa`. It produced 782 exact observations on `polygon.drpc.org` and 510 on `polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com`, with zero gross-positive candidates and negative nearest gross deltas. The scanner remains read-only.
- Frozen external evidence artifact remains `e117b6550686cf5e0ff787d9bd7d85e83996db07`; engineering commits after that artifact do not retroactively alter its identity. The latest verified engineering commit is **112 commits ahead** of the frozen artifact with no commits behind it, based on GitHub commit comparison. The current HEAD adds only status documentation on top of that verified engineering commit.
- Consolidated external-evidence validation remains hard-bound to the frozen external artifact and requires independent lane evidence for signer, Polygon authority, private relay, shadow/staging, and realized PnL.
- Operator preflight still requires current HEAD to descend from the frozen artifact and rejects missing or contradictory evidence.
- Certification PR `#1`: **OPEN / MERGE CONFLICTS**; merge is not required for external evidence capture.
- External evidence handoff issue `#2`: **OPEN / BLOCKED**; genuine current production evidence has not been accepted.
- Production readiness: **NOT ACHIEVED**
- Controlled production signer identity: **BLOCKED**
- Controlled production Polygon provider authority: **BLOCKED**
- Controlled production private relay: **BLOCKED**
- Controlled shadow/staging: **BLOCKED**
- Realized live PnL: **BLOCKED**
- Live mainnet execution: **BLOCKED**
- Live capital: **LOCKED**

## OPERATING MODE
Each `next` is a batch execution cycle: scan the complete mission state, identify the highest-value unresolved bottleneck, execute all independent repository-safe work that materially advances the mission, verify it, integrate it, and only then advance. Phase-19 is treated as an external verification gate, not as the project goal.

## SAFETY
No private key, seed phrase, keystore password, relay credential, authentication secret, raw signed transaction, public fallback, live broadcast, or live-capital operation is permitted in the certification workspace.

## P0 BLOCKERS
1. Real opportunity must be proven genuine and currently executable.
2. Controlled production signer identity proof.
3. Controlled production Polygon provider authority proof.
4. Controlled production private relay proof.
5. Controlled shadow/staging evidence using the identical immutable artifact chain.
6. Controlled realized settlement/PnL evidence with strict `net > $0.20` after all applicable costs.
7. Independent final re-audit.

**LIVE SIGNING = BLOCKED**
**PUBLIC BROADCAST = BLOCKED**
**LIVE CAPITAL = LOCKED**
